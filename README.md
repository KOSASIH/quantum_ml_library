# Installation

To install the Quantum Machine Learning Library, simply run the following command:
```
pip install quantum_ml_library
```
Alternatively, you can clone the repository and install it manually:
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/quantum_ml_library.git
cd quantum_ml_library
pip install .
```

# Usage

To use the Quantum Machine Learning Library, simply import the desired modules and start building your models. Here's an example of how to use the library to build a quantum support vector machine:
```
from quantum_ml_library.algorithms import QSVM
from quantum_ml_library.datasets import load_iris

# Load the iris dataset
X, y = load_iris()

# Create a quantum support vector machine
qsvc = QSVM()

# Train the model
qsvc.fit(X, y)

# Make predictions
predictions = qsvc.predict(X)
```
